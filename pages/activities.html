        <p>In this page we will publish the recent activities that are carried out by our research lab.</p>

        <h3>Fab. 2025 - PhD Defense for Alessandro Falcetta and Massimo Pavan</h3>
        <p>
            Big milestone for the AI-Tech Research Lab as Alessandro Falcetta and Massimo Pavan wrap up their PhDs. Their work in Privacy-Preserving Machine and Deep Learning and Tiny Machine Learning, respectively, has been an important part of what we do, and we're glad to have been part of their journey.

            The discussion, which took place on February 18, was chaired by Professor Giacomo Boracchi, with Prof. Eiman Kanjo and Dr. Manish Gupta serving as committee members.
            A lot of hard work, a lot of late nights, and nowâ€”onto whatever's next. Well done!

        <h3>Jan. 2025 - Seminar: Alternative Algorithms for Deep Learning: From Neuroscience to Technology</h3>
        <p>
            On Monday, January 27, 2025 from 5:30 p.m. to 6:15 p.m., Prof. Fabrizio Pittorino (Politecnico di Milano - AI-Tech Research Lab) will hold a seminar titled 'Alternative Algorithms for Deep Learning: From Neuroscience to Technology' in 'Emilio Gatti' Conference Room (Building 20), for the FAIR - Future Artificial Intelligence Research series.
            In this seminar, Prof. Pittorino will explore alternative algorithms for deep learning, inspired by the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While backpropagation has been a cornerstone of modern deep learning, its biological implausibility and computational inefficiencies have encouraged the development of new methods.
